# Zach-B---1.2.1-Interview-Questionnaire
* Specific Topic *
  This survey is a "Student Survey" to check in with students to see how they feel about about the new campus since this year is new for all of us. Basically just a basic student satisfaction survey. We need to obtain this data to hopefully improve general student life in the future and to display understanding of student opinion.

  # Questions #
  Starting Question: "How are you today?"
  1: "What grade are you in?"
  2: "What do you like to do? (Hobbies)"
  3: "Do you feel safe at school?"
  4: "Are you satisfied with your classes?"
  5: "Is learning a priority for you?"
  6: "Do you like the new school?"
  7: "Do you prefer the Dublin or Emerald campus?"
  8: "What classes would you want next year?"
  Ending Question: "Thank you for filling out this survey."
